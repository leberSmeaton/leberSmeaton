### Hi there (👍 ͡❛ ͜ʖ ͡❛)👍 I'm Bella.

- I am a junior developer about to graduate from Coder Academy, January 2022.

I consider myself a stakeholder management and engagement specialist with longterm project and business vision.
Driven by meeting project targets and specifications, I take pride in turning around quality projects within budget and looks to apply these principles as a web developer.
Combining my diverse career history and communication style with creative tech skills allows me to confidently converse with all levels of business and departments.

- ⚡ In 2021 I have undertaken Coder Academy's Dipoloma of IT - 10 month bootcamp in full stack web development.
- I went down this full stack path to test my skillset and to discern which tech pathway to begin embark on.

I am currently working in...
- 🌱 a team, building a React app with an internal Rails API and a relational PostgreSQL database. We are currently in the planning stage. Features include User authentication & authorisation with Devise and JWT, API testing with RSPEC and front end React testing with Jest. We'll be utilising Amazon S3 buckets for image hosting and hosting backend on Heroku and our front end on Netlify. You can see our teams current repo I am acting as project manager for here... [PicnicVic](https://github.com/PicnicVic/Main_T3A2-A).

Projects I've undertaken are,

- 🍺 A vanilla JS website for people who don't drink, for Teetotallers executed through General Assembly's part-time web development course. [Repo](https://github.com/leberSmeaton/TTotal) + [TTotal Live Site](https://vigilant-tereshkova-e7ec07.netlify.app)
- 🛒 A 2 sided Ruby-on-Rails marketplace web app for Arstist and Creatives when stuck in covid lockdown. Intregation with Stripe for payments. Plus a PostgreSQL database for development and production. [Repo here](https://github.com/leberSmeaton/lcm) + [Slow to load Live Site via Heroku](https://bellas-lcm.herokuapp.com)
- 🍿 A Ruby terminal app. A movie judge Terminal App that allows the user to input movie data and rate Academy Award winning movies. [Repo](https://github.com/leberSmeaton/oscars-terminal-app)
- 🌤 A basic front end weather app(using live API weather data) built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript which I've since rebuilt in React. This project was built through SheCodes learning. [React Repo](https://github.com/leberSmeaton/weather-react) + [Live Site](https://elated-easley-a2038c.netlify.app)
- 👯‍♀️ A [personal portfolio](https://bella-leber-smeaton-portfolio.netlify.app) built with HTML/CSS/JS, that I am currently updating and hoping to move into React.[Repo](https://github.com/leberSmeaton/portfolioT1A2)

- 🌱 I’m continually learning Git + the command line so I can be smoooooth operator. I am also familiar with the GitHub Desktop GUI. 

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with growing my JavaScript knowledge.
